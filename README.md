# Data-Analysis

## Abstract

This package contains a sandbox environment for analytic applications to deliver data analysis solutions.
The concepts revolve around standard data analytics, data statistics, and data integrity, along with various problems 
or challenges associated with these fields.

The project infrastructure is based on the Development Stages in the Data Analysis Life Cycle:

Many problems and challenges occur in a Data Analyst role containing a variety of complexity. The type of problems depends a lot on the databases and client responsibilities. Here, the databases selected are generalized based on common association. There are 7 different types:
* Business DB
* Legal DB
* Address DB
* Tax
* Finance
* Employee DB
* 9 Log DBs

Common scenarios a client may request, and the challenges associated with them, are shown below with their solutions.

* Generator: a generator that builds a database with a designed or random record infrastructure
* Insertion: various conditions that are inserted into the generated database to provide dynamic structure
* Data Integrity: various functions that conduct data checks and data cleaning for data integrity
* Data Analysis: various functions that perform tasks related to simulated data analysis objectives
